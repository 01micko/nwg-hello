This program is a GTK3-based greeter for the [greetd](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/greetd) daemon, written in python.
It is meant to work under a Wayland compositor, like Hyprland or sway. It does not support X11 sessions. The greeter
has been developed for use with the [nwg-iso](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-iso) project, but it may be configured
for standalone use.

# Features

- multi-monitor support with gtk-layer-shell
- multi-language support
- background & style customization with css
- automatically selects the last used session and user
- allows setting environment variables

# Dependencies

- python >= 3.6
- greetd
- gtk3
- gtk-layer-shell
- Hyprland or sway Wayland compositor

# Installation

The greeter can be installed by cloning this repository and executing the `install.sh` script (make sure you installed
dependencies first). Then you need to edit the `/etc/greetd/config.toml` file.

```toml
[terminal]
# The VT to run the greeter on. Can be "next", "current" or a number
# designating the VT.
vt = 1

# The default session, also known as the greeter.
[default_session]

# `agreety` is the bundled agetty/login-lookalike. You can replace `/bin/sh`
# with whatever you want started, such as `sway`.
command = "agreety --cmd /bin/sh"

# The user to run the command as. The privileges this user must have depends
# on the greeter. A graphical greeter may for example require the user to be
# in the `video` group.
user = "greeter"
```

Replace the line:

```toml
command = "agreety --cmd /bin/sh"
```

with

```toml
command = "Hyprland -c /etc/nwg-hello/hyprland.conf"
```

if you want to use Hyprland, or this line if you prefer sway:

```toml
command = "sway -c /etc/nwg-hello/sway-config"
```

## Tip

During the greetd package upgrades, the `config.toml` file may be overwritten with the default one. E.g. on Arch Linux
your modified file gets renamed to `config.toml.pacsave`. This will restore the `agreety` greeter on your system.
To avoid such a situation, you may use the alternative `greeter.conf` file. This has not been mentioned in docs, 
but greetd looks for this file fist. Just `# cp config.toml greetd.conf` and make changes there.
