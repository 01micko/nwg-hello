This program is a GTK3-based greeter for the [greetd](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/greetd) daemon, written in python.
It is meant to work under a Wayland compositor, like Hyprland or sway. It does not support X11 sessions. The greeter
has been developed for use with the [nwg-iso](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-iso) project, but it may be configured
for standalone use.
